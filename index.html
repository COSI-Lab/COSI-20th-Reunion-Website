<p>
  Happy 20th Year of the Clarkson Open Source Institute. To celebrate a group of COSI-naughts have been hard at work planning ways for us to reconnect and reminisce. Due to COVID-19 numbers and restrictions the majority of the Reunion is going to be Virtual. Clarkson has restriction on who is allowed on campus and so we will not be gathering at the physical labs at all. Hopefully in the years to come we can find a chance to get together in person when things are safer and more settled for everyone.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless we have a slate of wonderful events planned to take place throughout a week. We are hoping that as many COSI-naughts as possible will be able to make it to at least one of the events. You can find the details of the events below.</p>
<p>If you have any question feel reach out to reach out to cosi-reunion-committee@googlegroups.com or one of the co-chairs. We'd love to here from you. If you haven't filled out the Survey yet, please do so here <a href="https://forms.gle/n84qD2T8z1YmSR7v7"> Survey </a>. If you want to help spread the word feel free to use the resources below.</p> 
<p>
We'll be sending more information about how to send pictures and other things in for some of the events, but also feel free to email us things as you think of them.

      <h3>COSI Takeover - Reunion Kickoff<br></h3>
      <p>
	This will be the kickoff to our Reunion week. We hope to welcome everyone and give a bit of an orientation for the rest of the week. We hope to give everyone, current and alum, a chance to introduce themselves. You also get a chance to hear from current students about  what is going on in the labs. Generally this will be a nice chance for us all to start to get to know the different generations of COSI and also reconnect with old friends.

      <h3>COSI Storytime<br></h3>

      <p>
	Let's all do some reminiscing :-) We'd love for everyone to come share and listen to stories of COSI through the years. We are hoping to collect fun photos from throughout the years to share and the stories that go with them. We are going to be going 3-6pm and hope folks will drop in when they can. We are also going to try to do a group photo at 4pm and are hoping most people can come at that time. Please add photos to the google drive linked below. Everyone on the alumni mailing list should have access. If you don't havee access, feel free to request to join the mailing list <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/clarkson-cslab-alumni/"> HERE </a> and we'll get you added or just email us your photos at cosi-reunion-committee@googlegroups.com.

      <h3>& - Mnt. Ampersand Hike [IN PERSON]<br></h3>
      <p>
	For those who are local or would like to meet up with folks in person, COSI folks are going to be getting together to Hike Ampersand. We will be meeting at the trailhead starting around 10:30AM with a hope of starting about 11AM. It is a fairly steep hike so please where good shoes, some light layers, and clothes you don't mind getting dirty. Also bring water and a snack. We often will stop for food after the Hike, but that won't be until evening. If you'd like bring a old laptop so that you can participate in the tradition of dereferencing the NULL Pointer.

      <h3>COSI Takeover - Alumni Lightning Talks<br></h3>

      <p>
	We are taking over the regular COSI meeting. We are hoping the Alums will sign up to give 5min lightning talks. Talks can be about just about anything interesting, but some suggestions are the coolest open source software you've been using or contributing to, an interesting project you've been working on, a historical technology or software you've been playing with, etc.
